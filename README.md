# face-id

# # This amazing piece of code will take a face and try to id it.

With a few different modes, you are able to either detect faces or add new ones to
your database. The only piece I haven't really worked out is how to make an efficient
file setup of pictures and who gets what ID. As in there is no error trapping for ID's
yet.

# # Pieces you need to make this work

There are a couple things that need to be created before the system will record faces. First,
you need to create a file named 'face_to_id.txt' in the same folder as the 'face_id.py' file.
There also needs to be a new folder named 'subject' that will contain all the reference
pictures once they are taken. After that, the code should be good to go.


Big shout out to Sentdex and Codacus on Youtube. They got me through this.
